My name is [Sebastián Pérez Saaibi](https://linkedin.com/in/spsaaibi) and I do Machine Learning and Data Science at [Pager](https://pager.com). I love using Data and Applied Machine Learnings to solve **real world** technical and business problems. I like good coffee, spending time with my family, running, playing tennis and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17781840-sebastian-perez-saaibi).

I have a background in [Computational Science and Engineering](http://www.rw.ethz.ch/), as well as [Physics](https://fisica.uniandes.edu.co/en/) and [Mechanical Engineering](https://mecanica.uniandes.edu.co/index.php/en/). I founded a Predictive Analytics Startup in 2011, called [Aentropico](https://angel.co/aentropico) (and shut it down at the end of 2014). I enjoy talking about entrepreneurship, machine learning and data visualization.
